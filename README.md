Designing a circuit that includes a voltage divider, buffer, differential amplifier, hysteresis comparator, relay, and LED so that the smoke sensor can measure the concentration of smoke, and the alarm triggers at a certain smoke level.
The alarm will turn off once the smoke level drops, and the alarm status is indicated by an LED that I modeled with the Model Editor.
Through my analyses, I observed the correct functioning of the circuit.
